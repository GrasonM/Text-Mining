He recently left a job at jacobs engineering group where he worked for about 5 years. He started working at becton dickinson a few weeks ago. Referral to SMH was precipitated by pt seeing his PCP, Dr. Ford, for a physical and sharing concerns re: depression. He was having suicidal thoughts the week of 8/22/83 and noticed that his depression and anxiety symptoms were starting to interfere with work. Per Dr. Ford's recommendation, he contacted PAL for assistance. When screened for substance use, pt was referred to SMH for an intake. Pt was scheduled to be seen last week due to urgency of his depression and SI, but missed the intake appointment due to getting extremely intoxicated the night before. Pt presents today seeking individual therapy and psychiatry services to address longstanding depression.\n",

She is seeking help mainly around management of anxiety, and it is unclear to what extent alcohol (which she has not consumed since May 2016) is affecting her current situation.  Biological factors include likely primary mood and/or anxiety disorders (perhaps depression with panic attacks), consequences of long-term alcohol use. Important psychological factors include the loss of three improtant family members and the prior trauma at multiple times. Her social situation reflects isolation and an unfortunately high level of dependence on her children.  One important challenge is her discomfort with opening up and seeking care, which may benefit from positive treatment alliances.\n",

Specifically, since May 2012, she has lost 18 lbs, going from 128 lbs (BMI = 19.5, normal range) to 110.2 lbs (BMI = 16.8, underweight range) at a height of 5'8\" tall.  She has had amenorrhea for 2 months.  Her current weight is her lowest since high school, when she was a model and weighed 98 lbs (BMI = 14.9, underweight range).  At that time, she had amenorrhea, felt pressure to be thin in order to keep her job, and most likely met criteria for frank anorexia nervosa nervosa-restricting type.\n",
